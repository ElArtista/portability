[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gfx-rs/portability.svg)](https://gitter.im/gfx-rs/portability)

This is a prototype library implementing [Vulkan Portability Initiative](https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-announces-the-vulkan-portability-initiative) using gfx-rs [low-level core](http://gfx-rs.github.io/2017/07/24/low-level.html). See gfx-rs [meta issue](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/issues/1354) for backend limitations and further details.

## Check out
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability && cd portability
```

## Build

### Makefile (Unix)
```
make
```

### CMake (Window)
Build the Rust library (portability implementation):

```
cargo build --manifest-path libportability/Cargo.toml --features <vulkan|dx12|metal>
```

Build the native example:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target native_test
```

## Running Samples

### LunarG (API-Samples)
After building `portability` as shown above, grab a copy from https://github.com/LunarG/VulkanSamples.
Manually override the [`VULKAN_LOADER`](https://github.com/LunarG/VulkanSamples/blob/master/API-Samples/CMakeLists.txt#L189-L194) variable and set it to the portability library.
```
set (VULKAN_LOADER "path/to/portability/library")
```
Then proceed with the normal build instructions.

## Vulkan CTS coverage

Please visit [our wiki](https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability/wiki/Vulkan-CTS-status) for CTS hookup instructions. Once everything is set, you can generate the new results by calling `make cts` on Unix systems. When investigating a particular failure, it's handy to do `make cts debug=<test_name>`, which runs a single test under system debugger (gdb/lldb). For simply inspecting the log output, one can also do `make cts pick=<test_name>`.
